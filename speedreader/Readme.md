# About Speed Reading Program
This simple Java Swing program allows you to read with less distraction and eye
movement.

The program starts reading every word in the white text area on the left 'Reading'
panel. The default reading speed is set to 200 words per minute(WPM). You can 
change the speed on the 'Configuration' panel on the left.

You can copy text from elsewhere into the right 'Reading' area. Then start reading 
from there.

Another option is to load text from a file on your disk. Enter the fully-qualified file name on the left panel in the 'File Name' text field. Then, click the 'Load' button.
I use Tika open source to load the text; therefore, you can read from file types like
pdf, epub, doc, docx, etc.
