# Pi Sentry Alarm Service
This project contains main application logic for the Pi Alarm System (PAS).

- Worthy of unit tests are: collaborators & logic leaf notes (functional components).
- Worthy of test doubles may be: collaborators.
- We leave the wrappers to the integration.
- We try not to burden ourselves with unit tests for Value Objects (VOS)
